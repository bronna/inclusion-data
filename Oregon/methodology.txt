# METHODOLOGY

-----------------------------
2021 TO 2022 DATA

1. Downloaded state metrics data as a csv on Sep 26, 2023 from https://www.ode.state.or.us/data/reportcard/media.aspx by clicking on 'SPED District Media File' for the 2021-2022 School Year

2. Downloaded TIGER/Line Shapefiles for Oregon's year 2022 school districts from https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2022&layergroup=School+Districts. Downloaded on Sep 26, 2023. Downloaded Elementary, Secondary, and Unified SD files

3. Put all data files in 'original files' directory

4. Duplicated all original files to use for analysis

5. Loaded all three district .shp files into QGIS: Layer -> Add Layer -> Add Vector Layer

6. Merged and exported all three district .shp files: 'Merge vector layers'

7. Exported merged file to GeoJSON: right click on layer -> 'Export' -> 'Save Features As...' -> 'GeoJSON'

8. Using CLI, installed TopoJSON tools in data folder: npm install -g topojson-server topojson-client topojson-simplify

9. Converted GeoJSON file to TopoJSON: geo2topo input.geojson > output.topojson

10. Simplified the geo paths: topoquantize 1e5 < OR_SDs_merged.topojson | toposimplify -p 1e-5 > OR_SDs_simplified.topojson

11. Visually compared and checked the merged and simplified files using mapshaper: https://mapshaper.org/

12. Created Jupyter notebook in directory: jupyter notebook -> +new Python 3

13. Loaded in state data and federal geo data. Removed "SD" and "School District" from name columns in datasets to standardize naming. Joined the datasets

14. Found 30 non-matching entries in the federal data and and 29 non-matching entries in the state data

15. Manually matched up non-matching entries, using the state data's 'Institution Name' as the key identifier of a district

16. Calculated 'LRE Students >40% <80%' category. Converted 'Institution ID' and 'geometry_index' floats to integers, converted all '*' values to null. Dropped undefined districts. Sorted districts by alphabetical order

17. Exported the cleaned and formatted data as topojson: oregon_data.topojson

18. Imported the data into the javascript frontend with a .topojson extension. Changed the extension to .json


-----------------------------
2022 TO 2023 DATA

0. Rearranged data directory to organize data by year

1. Downloaded state special education metrics data as a csv on July 26, 2024 from https://www.ode.state.or.us/data/ReportCard/Media by clicking on 'SPED District Media File' for the 2022-2023 school year

1.5 Downloaded state gen ed data files on July 30, 2024 from same website for same school year. 'AAG Districts-Aggregated' for the gen ed enrollment. 'AAG Districts-Disaggregated' for the 5 year grad rates of students with disabilities

2. Downloaded TIGER/Line Shapefiles as .zip files for Oregon's year 2023 school districts from https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2023&layergroup=School+Districts. Downloaded on July 29, 2024. Downloaded Elementary, Secondary, and Unified SD files

3. Unzipped and moved the geo data files to the 'original files' '2022to23' directory

4. Duplicated all original files into '22to23' directory to use for analysis

5. Loaded all three district .shp files into QGIS: Layer -> Add Layer -> Add Vector Layer

6. Merged and exported all three district .shp files: Processing Toolbox on left -> search bar -> 'Merge vector layers'

7. Exported merged file to OR_SDs_merged_23: right click on layer -> 'Export' -> 'Save Features As...' -> 'GeoJSON'

8. Using CLI, installed TopoJSON tools in data folder: npm install -g topojson-server topojson-client topojson-simplify

9. Converted GeoJSON file to TopoJSON: geo2topo OR_SDs_merged_23.geojson > OR_SDs_merged_23.topojson

10. Simplified the geo paths: topoquantize 1e5 < OR_SDs_merged_23.topojson | toposimplify -p 1e-5 > OR_SDs_simplified_23.topojson

11. Visually compared and checked the merged and simplified files using mapshaper: https://mapshaper.org/

12. Duplicated last year's Jupyter notebook and added to '22to23' directory. Opened with CLI

12.5 Uploaded gen ed data files

13. Modified file names and loaded in state data and simplified federal geo data. Removed "SD" and "School District" from name columns in datasets to standardize naming. Joined all datasets

14. Found 30 non-matching entries in the federal data and and 29 non-matching entries in the state data

15. Manually matched up non-matching entries, using the state data's 'Institution Name' as the key identifier of a district. Had to modify a couple of the manually matched districts from last year to updated SD names (next year try fuzzy matching?)

16. Calculated 'LRE Students >40% <80%' category. Converted 'Institution ID' and 'geometry_index' floats to integers, converted all '*' values to null. Dropped undefined districts. Sorted districts by alphabetical order

16.5 THERE IS NO DATA IN THIS CSV FOR SUSPENSIONS, EXPULSIONS, AND DISPROPORTIONATE RACIAL REPRESENTATION

17. Exported the cleaned and formatted data as topojson: oregon_data.topojson

18. Imported the data into the javascript frontend with a .topojson extension. Changed the extension to .json


-----------------------------
2024-01-01: ADDED DISPROPORTIONATE REPRESENTATION INDICATORS for 22/23 SY

1. Obtained the missing indicators from ODE via email and renamed to "ODE_DisproportionateIndicators__20222023.csv"

2. 2. Modified the data processing pipeline in StateFedDataMergeOregon23.ipynb to:
   - Load the new CSV file, skipping the first 3 header rows
   - Clean and rename columns for the four indicators (SuspExplFg, SuspExplRaceEthnicityFg, DisPrptnRprsntnFg, DisPrptnRprsntnDsbltyFg)
   - Merge this data with existing district data using Institution ID as the key
   - Include these indicators in the final TopoJSON output as Yes/No values for each district

3. Uncommented the relevant properties in the topo_data update section of the notebook to ensure these new indicators are included in the final output.
